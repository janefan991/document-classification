# document-classification
It is an app that reads the data and creates a document classifier. It takes 6 command line inputs(pagecount, wordcount, filesize, author, title, createdate) and outputs a prediction result. 
It solves the multi-class classification problem with combination data type (nummerical and text) and compares the accuracy of different classifiers including LSTM, SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, Adaboost etc.
Online documentations and resources are used like https://medium.com/text-classification-algorithms/text-classification-algorithms-a-survey-a215b7ab7e2d, https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides when build this project.
